We are incredibly excited to invite our extended Ngubi family and friends to a special day of gratitude, nature, and community. This event is our way of saying thank you for walking with us on this journey, and to celebrate the opening of Ngubi Adventure Forest Camp.

It's a perfect opportunity to experience a taste of what we offer, bring your loved ones, and reconnect with nature in the beautiful Kikuyu Escarpment Forest. Children are warmly welcome to join in the fun!

**Event Highlights:**
* **10:00 AM - 11:00 AM:** Energizing Forest Bootcamp Exercise (suitable for all levels, optional participation).
* **11:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** Guided Forest Walk & Conservation Insights (learn about Ngubi's unique biodiversity and conservation efforts, including a symbolic tree planting session).
* **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM:** Community & Gratitude Session (short speech, thank you, and future vision sharing).
* **1:00 PM - 2:00 PM:** Complimentary Lunch for all registered attendees.
