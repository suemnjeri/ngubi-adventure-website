                Our story began in 2017 with a bold government tender application to lease a piece of the Ngubi Forest, within the greater Uplands forest system. Eight years later, after countless government offices, helpful staff, meticulous paperwork, and the support of many dedicated individuals, we have learnt lessons in  patience, faith, and immense gratitude.

                Today, our doors are finally open, and we are ready to welcome you to this wonderful piece of God's creation. We invite you to create memories, share adventures, and discover the wonder of this special forest alongside us.
